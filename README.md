# VHDL 100 Projects: From AND gate to CPUs and SOCs

Welcome to the **VHDL 100 Projects** repository! This collection presents a structured progression of **VHDL projects**, ranging from basic logic gates to a fully functional **mini CPU and SoC**. Each project is **fully synthesizable** and tested using **ModelSim simulations**, providing both the VHDL source code and accompanying test benches.  

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to learn or reference **VHDL**, **FPGA design**, or digital system development.
